The colour palette is designed to support a flexible, modular visual style that feels connected across EC and EU websites and platforms. The intent of the palette is to **convey a united and open European spirit**, and leave users feeling welcome and in good hands.

## Primary colours

The **primary colour palette** is comprised of blues, yellows and greys. These colours are present accross all pages and, together with the neutral white, they make up for about 80% of the colours in the page layout. Use these colours to **create consistency** and a strong **visual hierarchy** throughout the page.



### Variations



## Notification colours

The secondary colour palette is mainly used for notification colours. The secondary colours should make up 20% or less of the colour in the layout and should be used sparingly to highlight important information and calls to action.


## Background colour

White is the background colour of the EC-website.
