## Primary Font: Roboto

## Web Safe Font: Arial
We use Arial as an alternative font. It is similar in character and style to Roboto typeface and is a commonly available system font.
We set 16px (1rem) as the base font size for body text to ensure readability. It is the default font size for most browsers.





## Weight
Font weight is the thickness of a font's stroke, with various weights used to differentiate content hierarchy. The bold style emphasizes the importance in comparison with the regular font style in the font family. We use 400 for regular and 600 for bold. Usually, the bold style is assigned to headings. Regular text is used for body text.

## Line height
Line spacing is commonly measured as a percentage of font size. Conventional wisdom is that line spacing of 130%-150% is ideal for readability. In fact, anything from about 120% up to 200% is acceptable, but 150% tends to be the most quoted sweet spot (and a WCAG recommendation). You should experiment to see what looks best with your text. The line-height value is always divisible by 4 to support the grid.


## Line length
Line-length is the number of characters displayed in a single line. Lines that are too long or too short can distract readers. For readability, limit to no more than 80 characters including spaces for desktop. Line length for mobile is recommended to use 40 to 60 characters including space per line.
