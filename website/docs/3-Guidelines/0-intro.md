## Guidelines

The DS v1 is the EEA's design system, created with a set of guiding principles that followed throughout the process.
By following a user-centered design approach and best UX practices, the DS v1 is the result of in-depth research into the users' needs and goals, offering solutions that are assessed, tested and revised continuously. All components included in the DS v1 follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
