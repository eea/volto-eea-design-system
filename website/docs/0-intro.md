## Welcome to the EEA Design System

We created the EEA Design System (EEA-DS) to standardize the visual language and user experience of the EEAâ€™s online applications. 

This also allows us to be more effecient when creating online applications instead of reinventing the wheel over and over.

EEA-DS was built by a multi-disciplinary team of developers, designers, UX researchers, writers and data scientists. Combining the expertise of all of these roles allowed us to create a design system with a wide range of elements and for various target users (Web Designer, Web Writer/Content manager, Web Developer and Data scientist).

## What is a design system?

A design system is a catalogue of everything that makes up your digital product including user interface elements, writing style, guiding principles, coding standards, visual design, etc. using reusable components for easy development.

All library elements are accompanied by:

- documentation explaining what a component is and how it should be used
- a visual demonstration
- HTML/CSS code for implementation
