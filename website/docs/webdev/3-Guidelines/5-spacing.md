To ensure that layouts are visually balanced, most measurements align to 8px, which corresponds to both spacing and the overall layout. Components are sized in 8px increments, ensuring a consistent visual rhythm across each screen.
Smaller elements, such as icons, can align to a 4px grid, while typography can fall on a 4px baseline grid, meaning that each lineâ€™s typographic baseline is spaced in increments of 4px from its neighbor.
