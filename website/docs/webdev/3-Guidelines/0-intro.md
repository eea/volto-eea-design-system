## Guidelines

The DS v1 is the EEA's design system, created with a set of guiding principles that followed throughout the process.
By following a user-centered design approach and best UX practices, the DS v1 is the result of in-depth research into the users' needs and goals, offering solutions that are assessed, tested and revised continuously. All components included in the DS v1 follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

The main characteristics of our design system are:
- Minimal use of drop shadows
- Sharp edges and corners
- Uncluttered, distraction-free design
- High readability with clear typography
- Easily adjusted for responsive design

We emphasize more on functionality rather than appearance and in parallel we try to offer a consistent appearance irrespective of the screen resolution and types of devices. Trying not to use unnecessary designing elements, we focus on faster site designing and minimum loading time.
