Effective headings are recognizable immediately, and help readers understand the flow of content on the page.

### How to Use
- employ visual contrast to make headings stand out. Headings need to appear separate from the rest of the content on the page
- size matters: Headings should be big
- use headings as titles. If we’re labeling a section of a website, the heading serves as the title for the section
- be concise. Keep headings short. In some cases, it’s even okay to drop articles like “the” and “a,” as they can be assumed
- not all headings should be bold
