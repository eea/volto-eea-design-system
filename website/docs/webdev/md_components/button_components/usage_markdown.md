Buttons trigger an action in a web page. There are 4 variants of the button component with different levels of importance and usages.

## Primary Button

Use for basic and successful actions. They direct the user’s attention to the primary action the application is suggesting that the user take.

### Do's

- make sure the button‘s microcopy represents the action such as “Submit“ or “Register“
- use an icon only when it is necessary
- use to perform a new action, task, move to next step

### Don'ts

- don't assign an action that should be assigned for a CTA (Call To Action) or other variations of buttons
- don't use an icon when it is not relevant or necessary to the action

### When not to use

- don't use for navigation
- don't use for downloads
- don't use when the primary action is negative - use secondary button
- don't use when the action can't be undone, such as delete

## Secondary Button

Use for medium-emphasis actions. They contain actions that are important but aren’t the primary action. They are used to indicate a secondary action that compliments a primary action or to reduce visual noise when there are many actions of equal importance on the page.

### Do's

- ensure the button performs an action, such as "Cancel", "Delete," "Remove" or "Replace" as the secondary action next to the primary button
- use an icon only when it is necessary

### Don'ts

- don't use for primary positive actions – such as Submit, Send, Accept, Apply or navigation
- don't use on its own
- don't use for navigation
- don't use an icon when it is not relevant or necessary to the action

## Inverted Button

### When to use

- use inverted and inverted-green only on white or light color background
- use inverted-dark only on dark background

## Text link Button

Use for low-emphasis actions or for buttons that could have a long length text. It can be grouped with other buttons or placed independently.

### When to use

- use with low emphasis in a button group
- use on pages/cards when the main focus should be the content and not the button
- when there is a single action intended

### When not to use

- do not use for navigation purpose
