 Images must have natural snapshots that show unique situations.

### Do’s
-	use stylistic tools such as light, perspective, color, focus and composition to tell stories that are authentic and believable.
-	the content of the photographs should be positive, optimistic, natural, realistic, warm, and welcoming. Framing should be playful and feel spontaneous
-   use image copyrights to be respectful of the author’s ownership rights
### Don’ts
-	do not use images that are too dark or do not have enough contrast
-	do not use overlaying gradients
-	images that are too static or that appear too symmetrical should not be used
-	do not use images that are over exposed or over saturated
