Labels, Tags, or Badges are all types of classification component that help to categorize, organize, and label elements. Tags are used to call attention to new or updated content.

### Do's
- use them to draw attention to new, important content. Tags can focus attention on important content on that might otherwise be missed
- when needed to filter results with one or more tags
- to indicate the number of new or unread items within a container. For example, to indicate the number of unread emails within a person’s inbox

### Don'ts
- if your tags aren’t interactive, disable hover, focus, and active styles
- don’t mix interactive and static tags
- don’t overdo it. If everything on a page is called out as important, nothing commands unique attention.
