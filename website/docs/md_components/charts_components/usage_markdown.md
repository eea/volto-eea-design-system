### Static and Interactive 

Data accuracy and integrity come first. Don’t distort or confuse the information for embellishment or partiality. Emphasize clarity and transparency. Reduce cognitive load and focus on what matters. Every action, color, and visual element should support data insights and understanding.

### Use the interactive chart if: 

- You want to give the user the possibility to visually filter data  

- You want the user to gain insights before filtering large datasets 


### Do not use the interactive chart if: 

- You want to visualize data without using it for filtering

- You are not using the visual filter bar
