Progress indicators tell users that more time is needed to process the last user action (for instance, to load a file, or to install a new update), and how much time remains.

### Do’s
-	use a progress indicator for any action that takes longer than about 1.0 second
-	use Looped animation only for fast actions. The animated-spinner icon is an example of this common progress indicator. This indicator should be used for actions that take between 2-10 seconds
-	percent-done animation: Use for actions that take 10 seconds or more.

### Don’ts
-	do not use static progress indicators
