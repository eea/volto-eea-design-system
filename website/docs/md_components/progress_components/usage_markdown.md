Progress indicators tell users that more time is needed to process the last user action (for instance, to load a file, or to install a new update), and how much time remains.

## Do’s
-	Use a progress indicator for any action that takes longer than about 1.0 second

-	Use Looped animation only for fast actions. The animated-spinner icon is an example of this common progress indicator. This indicator should be used for actions that take between 2-10 seconds

-	Percent-done animation: Use for actions that take 10 seconds or more.

## Don’ts
-	Do not use Static progress indicators
