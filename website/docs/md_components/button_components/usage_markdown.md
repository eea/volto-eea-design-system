Buttons trigger an action in a web page. There are 4 variants of the button component with different levels of importance and usages.

# Primary Button

Use for basic and successful actions. They direct the user’s attention to the primary action the application is suggesting that the user take.

## Do's

- Make sure the button‘s microcopy represents the action such as “Submit“ or “Register“
- Use an icon only when it is necessary
- Use to perform a new action, task, move to next step

## Don'ts

- Don't assign an action that should be assigned for a CTA or other variations of buttons
- Don't use an icon when it is not relevant or necessary to the action

## When not to use

- Do not use for navigation
- Do not use for downloads
- Do not use when the primary action is negative - use secondary button
- Do not use when the action can't be undone, such as delete

# Secondary Button

Use for medium-emphasis actions. They contain actions that are important but aren’t the primary action. They are used to indicate a secondary action that compliments a primary action or to reduce visual noise when there are many actions of equal importance on the page.

## Do's

- Ensure the button functions an action, such as "Cancel", "Delete," "Remove" or "Replace" as the secondary action next to the primary button
- Use an icon only when it is necessary

## Don'ts

- Do not use for primary positive actions – such as Submit, Send, Accept, Apply or navigation
- Do not use on its own
- Do not use for navigation
- Don't use an icon when it is not relevant or necessary to the action

# Text link Button 
Use for low-emphasis actions or for buttons that could have a long length text. It can be grouped with other buttons or placed independently.
## When to use
- use with low emphasis in a button group
- use on pages/cards when the main focus should be the content and not the button
- when there is a single action intended
## When not to use
- do not use for navigation purpose
