The tabs component lets users navigate between related sections of content, displaying one section at a time.

### Do’s
Tabs can be useful for users to quickly switch between related information if:
- your content can be usefully separated into sections
- the first section is more relevant than the others for most users
- users will not need to view all the sections at once

### Don’ts
Tabs hide content from users and not everyone will notice them or understand how they work.
Do not use tabs if your users might need to:
- read all the content in order, for example, to understand a step-by-step process
- compare information in different tabs

Having to memorize information and switch between tabs can be frustrating. Test your content without tabs first. 

Consider if it is better to:
-	simplify and reduce the amount of content
-	split the content across multiple pages
-	keep the content on a single page, separated by headings
-	use a table of contents to let users navigate quickly to specific sections of content

### Tab labels
- use short tab labels to appear in a single row. In exceptions, they can use a second line if needed, with a tab max widht of 250px. Alternatively, you can use scrollable tabs to allow room for longer titles
- don’t truncate labels unless required, as truncated text can impede comprehension
- tab labels should consist of 1 – 2 words: Labels on tabs should clearly describe their function or destination within 2 words at most. Constraining yourself to 1 – 2 words will also help you in thinking more about selecting the best words for your tab labels.
