Effective headings are recognizable immediately, and help readers understand the flow of content on the page

## How to Use
- Employ Visual Contrast to Make Headings Stand Out. Headings need to appear separate from the rest of the content on the page.
- Size matters: Headings Should Be Big
- Use Headings as Titles. If we’re labeling a section of a website, the heading serves as the title for the section
- Be Concise. Keep headings short. In some cases, it’s even okay to drop articles like “the” and “a,” as they can be assumed.
- Not all headings should be bold
