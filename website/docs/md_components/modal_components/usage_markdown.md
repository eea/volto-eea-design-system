Modals appear on top of the main content and require user interaction. This dialog disables the main content until the user explicitly interacts with the modal dialog.

### Do’s
-	Use modal dialogs for important warnings, to prevent or correct critical errors
-	Use modal dialogs to request the user to enter information critical to continuing the current process
-	Modal dialogs can be used to fragment a complex workflow into simpler steps

### Don’ts
-	Do not use modal dialogs for nonessential information that is not related to the current user flow
-	Avoid modal dialogs that interrupt high-stake processes
-	Avoid modal dialogues for complex decision making that require additional sources of information unavailable in the modal
