# Intro

The EEA Searchlib is a React library on top of ElasticSearch's SearchUI that
will help you easily build and integrate search engines in EEA websites.

It provides several ways of integration:

- as Volto components (TBD)
- a standalone React application (TBD, now running in demo)
- as part of a classic Plone addon

We also provide Storybook for demo and testing purposes.
