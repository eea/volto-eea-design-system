### EEA Design System (1.0.0)

#### Components ready to be used

The following components are ready to be used as Volto `blocks`, `slate` integration, or via the advanced `block styler`:
- Accordion `block`
- Call to Action `block`
- Callout - part of the Description `block`, `slate`
- Card - part of the Teaser `block` and Listing `block`, it includes several variations like round card e.g., used for Avatar
- Divider `block`
- Headings `slate`
- Hero `block`
- Item `block` - used for text with an icon (remixicon or custom SVG/image) on the left/right
- List `slate` - ordered and unordered
- Quote `block`
- Statistic `block`
- Tag `block`
- Table `block`
- Tabs `block`
- Timeline `block`

#### Future releases

Below is a non-exhaustive list of the work-in-progress which is planned for future releases:
- Navigation Portlet (used on the left/right hand of content) is still WIP and should not be used
- When using the Table `block`, please be aware of enabling the responsive design manually (it should be on by default in later releases)
- Description list (dt, dd) is still missing from slate editor
- Slate enhancements, e.g. the inclusion of various font weights and text alignment (left, centered, right)
- Spacing/padding system via the `block styler`. We do have design-tokens; however, these are not exposed to the volto block styler. We want to add the ability for editors to consistently apply various spacing/padding on certain components in order to allow a better alignment when components are used together.
- Harmonize component naming across docusarurus, storybook, code, and Volto.
- Improve docusaurus and storybook with more components, controls, and variations in order to better reflect what is possible in Volto.
